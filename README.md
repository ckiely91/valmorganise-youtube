# Valmorganise YouTube

## Overview

Ever since the rise of the television age, the debate has raged on - why go to the cinema anymore when we could just watch movies on our televisions? And now with the rise of the internet and ubiquitous availability of content, many have pronounced the cinema finally dead, hoist by the unstoppable tide of technology.

But the silver screen still has an edge. Cinema-goers the world over still show up in their hundreds and thousands, to bear witness to something beautiful that, until now, remained exclusive to the movie theatre - the **Val Morgan Pre-Show**.

So I decided it's time to bring that magic to the home. **Valmorganise YouTube** is a handy Chrome extension that allows you to experience the Val Morgan Pre-Show promo before *every YouTube video you watch*.

## Installation

The Establishment is stuck in its old ways and is resistant to change. So for now, this is an unofficial Chrome extension. Follow these steps to install it:

1. Download [valmorganise-youtube.zip](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1g1iSQ6JFX-_pkq-BJz01SB3ppnlwOZmH/view?usp=sharing).
2. Navigate to `chrome://extensions` in your Google Chrome browser.
3. Enable "Developer Mode".
4. Drag the `valmorganise-youtube.zip` file into your browser window.

Now you can navigate to any video on youtube.com and enjoy the deeper engagement.
